Design and management of relational databases.
Perform queries, joins, and data extraction to prepare it for analysis.
Python:

Data manipulation, cleaning, and handling missing values using libraries like Pandas.
Data is prepared in a clean format and exported for visualization.
Power BI:

Create dynamic dashboards for visual insights into sales, customer behavior, and business performance.
Tools Used
SQL Server: For database creation, query execution, and data extraction.
Python: For data cleaning and preparation using Pandas and Matplotlib.
Power BI: For visualizing data and creating interactive reports.
Steps
Step 1: SQL Server
Objective: Create and manage the database, and prepare the data for analysis.
Actions:
Create the necessary tables and populate them with the provided data.
Perform SQL queries to join tables and prepare data for extraction.
Export the cleaned and processed data to a CSV file.
Outcome: The data is now ready for further analysis in Python.
Step 2: Python
Objective: Clean and manipulate the extracted data for better analysis and visualization.
Actions:
Load the extracted CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values and filter unnecessary records.
Prepare the data in a format suitable for visualization in Power BI.
Outcome: Clean data is ready for use in Power BI dashboards.
Step 3: Power BI
Objective: Visualize the cleaned data to gain insights into sales, customer demographics, and business performance.
Actions:
Import the cleaned data into Power BI.
Create dashboards including:
Sales Overview
Customer Behavior Analysis
Music Performance by genre and artist
Generate insights and reports for business intelligence.
Outcome: Interactive dashboards and reports providing actionable insights.
Summary
