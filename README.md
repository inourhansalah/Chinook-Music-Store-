# Data Analysis with SQL Server, Python, and Power BI

## Project Overview

This project focuses on utilizing SQL Server, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize business data efficiently. The tools were used collaboratively to manage the data pipeline, from database creation and management, through data manipulation and analysis, to dynamic reporting with Power BI.

### Key Technologies:

- **SQL Server**: Used for relational database design and complex queries to structure and retrieve data.
- **Python**: Employed for data manipulation and automation using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Power BI**: Implemented for interactive business intelligence reporting, providing insightful visualizations.

## SQL Server

In this phase, SQL Server was utilized to design and manage relational databases. Complex queries and joins were used to handle the data effectively, preparing it for subsequent analysis. After creating and filling tables with data, the database was exported as a CSV file.

### SQL Highlights:

- Table creation and data filling.
- Data handling through complex queries and joins.
- Exporting the data as CSV for analysis.

---

## Python

Python's data manipulation libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) were leveraged to clean and process the data before analysis. Missing values were handled, and unnecessary records were filtered out to streamline the dataset for analysis in Power BI.

### Python Highlights:

- Data loaded into DataFrames using Pandas.
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
- Prepared data for visualization in Power BI.

## Power BI

Power BI was utilized to create dynamic dashboards, turning raw data into actionable insights. The focus was on visualizing sales data, customer demographics, and music performance.

### Power BI Highlights:

- Sales Overview: Visualizing total sales, genre popularity, and key performance indicators.
- Customer Demographics: Breakdown of customer engagement by geography and purchase risk levels.
- Interactive dashboards: Enabled detailed insights and tracking of performance over a 4-year span (2021-2024).

## Recommendations:

1. **Targeted Marketing**: Develop campaigns focused on popular genres (e.g., Rock, Alternative).
2. **Customer Retention**: Implement loyalty programs and re-engagement strategies for at-risk customers.
3. **Expand Geographic Reach**: Tailor promotions for high-performing cities like Berlin and London.
4. **Diverse Offerings**: Explore niche genres and focus on short tracks to increase discoverability.

## Summary:

- **SQL Server**: Structured and managed relational data for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Python**: Cleaned and processed data, preparing it for visualization.
- **Power BI**: Created interactive reports that provided valuable business insights.
